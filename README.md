# JOANAConnector
The JOANAConnector Project provides capabilities to execute the client-server functionalites of the [Java Object-sensitive ANAlysis (JOANA)](https://github.com/joana-team/joana) information flow control analysis.
For this purpose, annotations can be specified programatically and then be send to the JOANA server. 
After the calculation, the results are retrieved and stored in an object.
